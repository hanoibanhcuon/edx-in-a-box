It includes a couple sample courses so you can see examples for how to author your own courses.\r\n\r\nOnce you download the script and double-click on it, the script will do the following:\r\n\r\n* Download and Install Virtualbox (if not already installed)\r\n* Download and Install Vagrant (if not already installed)\r\n* Download the edX .box image file (if not already downloaded)\r\n* Import the edX .box image file into VirtualBox\r\n* Download and install the edx4edx_lite sample course\r\n* Download and install the 18.02SC Multivariable Calculus sample course\r\n* Start the newly installed/configured VM\r\n* Print a message of what to do next, and where to find more docs\r\n\r\n### Mac users\r\nThe script has the extension ```.tool``` which on MacOSX makes it clickable as an executable file. \r\n\r\nThe files will be copied to the ~/mitvm-vagrant directory on your computer, so on a Mac this will be ```/Users/<username>/mitvm-vagrant```\r\n\r\n### Linux users\r\nLinux users can rename this to edx-installer.sh and run it with bash.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv edx-installer.tool edx-installer.sh\r\n$ chmod +x edx-installer.sh\r\n$ ./edx-installer.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe script is maintained by Nate Aune (@natea) but all the hard work was done by Ike Chuang (@ichuang). This script is just a wrapper around his instructions, to make it easier to get the system dependencies installed with as few clicks as possible.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with edX-in-a-box?
